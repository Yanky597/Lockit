# Lockit

Lockit is an android app I created to store passwords locally on my phone. 
I initially created it for a semester project for an android development course at college. \
However I've continued to work on it as I've found it to be be very useful.
The app allows you to generate "Strong" passwords as well as store them locally on your phone.
I don't claim that this is a secure app, however I have been working 
to gradually make it more secure while learning some best practices for android security along the way.
